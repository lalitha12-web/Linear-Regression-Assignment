## General Information
**Problem Statement**
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic.The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario.So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

**Bussiness goal**
BoomBikes want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

The company wants to know:
* Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
* How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
**Train Data R^2 (79.1%):**
The model explains approximately 79.1% of the variance in the train data. This high R^2 value indicates that the model fits the train data well and has strong explanatory power.

**Test Data R^2 (76.9%):**
The model explains approximately 76.9% of the variance in the test data. The slightly lower R^2 value compared to the train data suggests that the model performs slightly less well on the test data, but it still has good explanatory power.

**Significant Variables for Predicting Bike Demand:**
These variables temperature, working day, wind speed, year, day of the week, weather conditions, and seasonal and monthly variationsâ€”strongly affect bike demand.
